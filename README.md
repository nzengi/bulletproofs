# Bulletproofs with Pedersen Commitments and Range Proofs

This project is a C++ implementation of Pedersen commitments and range proofs using the `secp256k1` cryptographic library. It includes modularized classes to handle commitments, range proofs, and public key operations. The project demonstrates the integration of `secp256k1` with custom classes to handle cryptographic tasks such as verifying range proofs.
